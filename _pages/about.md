Hello, I'm a PhD researcher specializing in <font color='#173cd6'>geospatial data</font>. My focus is on enhancing accessibility to data from remote sensors. I bridge the gap between data users and providers, emphasizing open source geospatial software and collaboration across Earth Science communities to maximize open geospatial data's potential.<br>
You can find me on [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Ariza2), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexander-ariza)  and [GitHub](https://github.com/Alexanderariza).

- Geospatial data analysis 
------
I do research, techening and consultancy work on open geospatial data and software on Geo-information and remote sensing, Physical Geography, Environmental Sciences, Geomatic applied to Risk Management. [workshops](/talks), mainly on interactive Geospatial data analysis, with Jupyter notebooks, Python and R.<br>
Projects I have been working on recently:<br>
  - *Main developer and content lead* - [**Forest fire monitoring on GEE**](http://incendios.fan-bo.org/Satrifo/), training programme of [RedLatif](https://gofcgold.org/regional-networks/red-latinoamerica-deteledeteccion-e-incendios-forestales-redlatif) and [FAN Fundation](http://www.fan-bo.org/), an online coding programme to develop Forest Fire-related open-source software.<br>
  - *Visiting Scientist and content support* - [**Recommended Practices development**](http://www.un-spider.org/advisory-support/recommended-practices), a series of procediments using space technologies for disaster risk management and emergency response, including Landsat, MODIS, Sentinel-5p, Sentinel-3, GOME-2, IASI and PROBA-V data. *(in collaboration with <a href="http://www.un-spider.org/">UN-SPIDER</a> and <a href="https://www.unoosa.org/" target="_blank">ONOOSA.</a>)*<br>
  - *Main developer and project lead* - **Development of DEWS Decision Support System**, to face or minimize the impacts of forest fires in Central and South America, Organized by the United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs[UNOOSA](https://www.unoosa.org/).
  - *CAL/Val Team* - [**FAC Satellite Capabilities in Antarctica**](https://www.fac.mil.co/facsat-1-un-a%C3%B1o-en-el-espacio), the research project for Calibration of Optical Systems Cubesat: Factsat-1 that responsible for calibrating optical spectrometer systems at the Earth Observation Center group of [AIr Force of Colombia - FAC](https://www.fac.mil.co/). *(in collaboration with <a href="https://ciaf.igac.gov.co/">CIAF</a> and <a href="https://minciencias.gov.co/">MINCIENCIAS.</a>)*<br>

- Postdoctoral researcher
------
I finished a [PhD at the Faculty of Geography at University of Alcal√° , Alcala de Henares, Madrid](https://geogra.uah.es/?phase=1&subpage=aims&subprojectid=1013), in collaboration with [GITA research Grup](https://geogra.uah.es/gita/) and [Earth Observation Group for the Quantitative Dynamics of the Biosphere](http://www.upm.es/observatorio/vi/index.jsp?pageac=grupo.jsp&idGrupo=640) of [Polytechnic University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/),. My research focuses on analysis of changes in the structure of the landscape by forest fires by detection, and how we can support this with the Big Data technologies, and cloud computing. I am interested in how big data technologies like Google Earth Engine or Sentinel Playground can be leveraged to provide efficient cloud geospatial data services
it is a methodology.

- Network builder
------
  - *Member* - [The Latin-American Network for Remote Sensing and Forest Fires (RedLaTIF)](https://gofcgold.org/regional-networks/red-latinoamerica-deteledeteccion-e-incendios-forestales-redlatif) -  is a regional network established in 2002 under the Global Observations of Forest and Land Dynamics (GOFC/GOLD)-Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme. 

  - *Co-Founder* - [IO-Star](https://alexanderariza.github.io/sortzen.geo.github.io/) - Launched in 2020, IO.Star is a initiative that seeks to promote and bring the use of geospatial technology to the solution of global problems. Is a technology-based initiative specialized in data processing and satellite images for hydrology, water quality, environmental assessment, and land cover mapping, among other services. IO-Star handles the entire data flow from receipt, satellite image processing to delivery of final products. [Join us!](https://alexanderariza.github.io/sortzen.geo.github.io/)
